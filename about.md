_"Music was created on our beautiful earth for healing our soul.
I truly believe in music, any music; Jazz, Disco, Funk.
Music has no nationality, no discrimination, no border.
Listen and dance to the music, let it go across from place to place, from men to women, from black to white, from father to son, from brother to brother, from soul to soul."_

# Soulhealing Radio

So, what are we doing here? â€“ We play records. That's it!

Soulhealing was founded by Jesus Fipsuz and Manumaticx as an expression for our DJ mixes. It's not an actual program. We are no professional DJs, we just like to put on some wax. So please, excuse every wack transition! Admittedly, we play lots of rap music as we were making rap music together since about 2001, actually still doin' it. But you'll hear tons of other stuff here. Most of all 70s! You know, diggin' samples for our beats brought us to some really great Funk and Soul tunes. You'll hear lots of Jazz and Latin music in our mixes but also Reggae, Afrobeat, Folk and so on. It's hard to categorize but Fipsuz described it very well with the term "Dusty Grooves".

We are recording Tapes since the 90s. In late 2012, Fips had the idea to bring it to the internet. So he put on some vinyl records, recorded it and uploaded our first episode. Since early 2014 we are recording more frequently and also started to record sessions with friends and other crate diggers like our homies Smoothinsky, Romesn, Mako Wu and Knoten. And it's going to be more. More music, more Soulhealing!
